                    <p>Before moving to Shipt, I worked as a Freight Broker for a company called Landstar Transportation. I worked there for around a year before realizing that sales was not my long term goal. I really enjoyed my time here and now know more about trucks than most should. Did you know that, depending on the load, a truck driver has to have a certain style of tie-downs or they cannot load?</p>

I ended up working with the grounds crew, working the pro-shop, caddying, working in the kitchen, and even being the on-course beverage person when we needed a fill in!</p>
